                    The Aging of the population has become a problem of widespread concern in society. Many lone elderly people, when their health problems occur, are there any ways to discover this situation in time? My idea is to make a The app can monitor the physical condition of the elderly in real time, whether it is children or the governmentYou can monitor your family’s health data in real time, such as acute diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, etc. The app can call an ambulance in time when there is an

                    <p>
                    <p> Motivation</p>

                    The Australian population is ageing, with older Australians a growing proportion of the total population. In 2017, 15% of Australians (3.8 million) were aged 65 and over; this proportion is projected to grow steadily over the coming decades.
                    Growth in the proportion of older Australians is partly due to increasing life expectancy: in 2014–16, a 65-year-old man could expect to live another 20 years and a 65-year-old woman another 22 years—7 years longer for both sexes than in the mid-1960s. Overall, Australians now enjoy one of the highest life expectancies in the world. These increases in life expectancy have generally not come at the expense of reduced functioning or worsened general health (see Health and functioning). This is a very Astonishing data.At the same time, the chance of old people suffering from diseases is very high This shows the importance of this app.

                    <p> Description.</p>

                    This application is composed of two aspects. The first part is that a medical device is similar to a bracelet that can be worn on the hand to monitor real-time data. The second part is that a mobile phone app can be connected to the bracelet to remotely monitor health conditions. The first part is made up of The second part of the partner is the project we are going to do. This app is mainly for the elderly and children. First of all, our app will provide GPS location services. Elderly people with Alzheimer’s can monitor where they go in real time. When they get lost, they can quickly find it on the mobile app. They, of course, our app also takes care of the health system. Patients suffering from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and heart disease can monitor their own physical condition through the mobile app without noticing them. Family and children can also see the data. The elderly who live alone can travel far away. Children who do not live together will be more at ease if they monitor the real-time situation. They will not worry about it all the time. Of course, we also have a chat system that can establish a group chat for lonely elderly people, so that old people can make some nearby friends or neighbors. It is also feasible for old people to share their real-time data into group chats. , People in group chat can take care of each other, and they can also see each other's physical condition on the app. When they find that their physical condition is not right, they can call an ambulance for the patient in time to escort the elderly.Of course, there are also smart apps on our app. You can play Sudoku games to exercise the brain power of the elderly and prevent Alzheimer’s. We will comprehensively evaluate your physical condition today based on data such as blood pressure, blood lipids and blood sugar, every month There will be a bar graph to show that your physical condition is rising or falling this month and recommend some health products and exercise equipment for you. Elderly people can also choose suitable health products to protect their health. We will also follow the physical conditions. We recommend crutches and fall prevention belts for some elderly people with inconvenient legs to protect their physical health. Of course, this software is not only for the elderly, but also for young people and children. For example, young people can watch it when exercising. In terms of your heart rate and calories burned, in general this app can pay attention to everyone’s health and protect people’s health

                        If the project is successful, it will be a great boon for the elderly and children in Australia. It will make young people feel relieved that the elderly living alone at home will not have any negative effects, only good effects, and the elderly can relax more. In life, you can observe your own physical condition. Young people who are working can easily see the data on the mobile phone and monitor the health of the old people in real time, which ensures the safety of the old people to a greater extent and solves the problem to a large extent. A big heart disease of young people

                        in the big five personality Your personality traits interact to create unique patterns of thought and behavior. In this section, you'll learn how your traits work together to drive the way you interact with the world.
To describe your personality patterns, we use a circular graph called a circumplex. The circumplex is used by psychologists to illustrate how two traits intersect to create more complex patterns of thought and behavior. Each circumplex has four sections, with each section describing a typical pattern. The area of each section shows how well that pattern describes you. A larger area indicates a better fit for that pattern.
Some circumplex graphs will show a clear preference for one pattern. Others will show a more even spread over two or even three patterns. Where you have nearly equal scores for two or more patterns, you can expect that both patterns may describe you equally well.

The results given by these two tests prove that I am a very sensitive person who can make very precise plans. In the team, I can act as the leader of the plan and assign the plan. I can quickly realize the problem of the plan. , It is of great help to the whole team, and I also have many shortcomings in the process of learning. Education planner test results suggest me （Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well.）
